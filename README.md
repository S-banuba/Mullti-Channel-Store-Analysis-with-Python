    Not much significant difference in orders made on the day of the week.
    
# Recommendations:
  a). Management should keep the multichannel business model especially In-Store and Online channels.
  
  b). Further investigation to find why growth is steady between 2019 and 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019.
  
  c.) Strategies needed to boost orders within the first six months of the year.
